# üñ•Ô∏è IT Help Desk Ticketing System (osTicket Lab Project)

This project demonstrates how I set up and configured an **IT Help Desk Ticketing System** using **osTicket** in a local lab environment with **XAMPP**. It simulates real-world help desk workflows such as ticket creation, triage, assignment, and resolution.  

##  Tools & Technologies
- **osTicket** (Open-source Ticketing System)  
- **XAMPP** (Apache, MySQL, PHP)  
- **phpMyAdmin** (Database management)  
- **Windows 10** (Lab environment)
  

##  Project Overview
1. Installed and configured **XAMPP** to provide the web server and MySQL database.  
2. Deployed **osTicket** in the XAMPP `htdocs` directory.  
3. Created a MySQL database via **phpMyAdmin** for osTicket.  
4. Configured osTicket through the setup wizard and created an **admin account**.  
5. Simulated **help desk tickets**:
   - Password reset requests  
   - Printer troubleshooting  
   - Software installation requests  
6. Demonstrated full ticket lifecycle:
   - **User submits ticket**  
   - **Technician triages and assigns ticket**  
   - **Ticket resolved and closed with documentation**
